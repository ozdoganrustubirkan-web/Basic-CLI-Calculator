Simple Command-Line Calculator

This Python script functions as a command-line calculator designed to execute eight distinct operations, encompassing basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /) and advanced functions 
(Exponent, SquareRoot, AbsoluteValue, and Rounding). The application's core logic utilizes an extensive if/elif control flow structure to accurately parse the user's selected operation 
and direct the program flow accordingly. For powerful mathematical tasks, such as calculating the square root, the script leverages the necessary functions imported from the standard math library. 
This implementation also includes specific error handling mechanisms to prevent program termination from issues like non-numeric input or division by zero.

How to Run
Save the code as calculator.py.

Execute in terminal: python calculator.py
